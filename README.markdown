# WRONG

The `WeightedRandomObjectNumberGenerator` class is a simplistic way
of generating random elements given a list of weighted objects. I've
been using it to seed large datasets with relatively predictable data
for use in data analysis.

Complete random data wouldn't help be; I need some level of general
predictability in order to veryify/validate various algorithms. In 
addition, I need to create general purpose collections of data of
existing types, with existing objects.
